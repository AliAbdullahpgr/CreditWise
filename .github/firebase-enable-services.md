## 📋 **Quick Fix Checklist:**

### 1. **Enable Firestore Database**
🔗 **Go to:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hisaabscore/firestore

**What you should see:**
- ✅ "Cloud Firestore" dashboard with collections
- ❌ "Get started" button (means not enabled)

**If not enabled:**
1. Click **"Create database"**
2. Choose **"Start in production mode"** 
3. Select location: **us-central1** (or closest to you)
4. Click **"Enable"**

---

### 2. **Enable Firebase Storage**
🔗 **Go to:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hisaabscore/storage

**What you should see:**
- ✅ Storage bucket with files/folders
- ❌ "Get started" button (means not enabled)

**If not enabled:**
1. Click **"Get started"**
2. Keep default rules: **"Start in production mode"**
3. Choose same location as Firestore
4. Click **"Done"**

---

### 3. **Set Temporary Open Rules (FOR TESTING ONLY)**

#### Firestore Rules:
🔗 **Go to:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hisaabscore/firestore/rules

**Replace content with:**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```
**Click "Publish"**

#### Storage Rules:
🔗 **Go to:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hisaabscore/storage/rules

**Replace content with:**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```
**Click "Publish"**

## 🧪 **Test After Enabling:**

1. **Restart your dev server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop with Ctrl+C, then:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Go to:** http://localhost:9003/documents

3. **Open Console** (F12)

4. **Upload a small image file**

5. **Watch for console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   🚀 [UPLOAD START]

## ❌ **If Still Stuck, Check These:**

### Console Errors to Look For:
- `Firebase: Error (auth/project-not-found)` → Wrong project ID
- `Missing or insufficient permissions` → Rules too strict
- `Storage bucket not found` → Storage not enabled
- `Collection not found` → Firestore not enabled
- `Quota exceeded` → Gemini API limit hit

### Network Tab Errors:
- Failed requests to `firebaseapp.com`
- 403 Forbidden errors
- 500 Server errors

---

## 🎯 **Most Common Solution:**

**90% of the time, it's simply:**
1. Firestore not enabled → Enable it
2. Storage not enabled → Enable it  
3. Rules too strict → Set to `allow read, write: if true`

After enabling services and setting rules, the upload should work!

**Try these steps and tell me:**
1. Were Firestore/Storage already enabled?
2. What console errors do you see now?
3. Does the upload progress further?
