# 💾 Skip Firebase Storage - Process Files Directly

## Problem: Firebase Storage requires Blaze (paid) plan

## Solution: Process files without storing them

This modification processes documents directly without uploading to Storage:

## 🔧 Code Changes Needed

### 1. Update Documents Page Upload Function

Replace the storage upload section in `src/app/(app)/documents/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// REMOVE this section:
// 2. Upload to Firebase Storage
const storageRef = ref(storage, storagePath);
await uploadBytes(storageRef, file);
const downloadUrl = await getDownloadURL(storageRef);

// REPLACE with:
// 2. Skip storage, use placeholder URL
console.log('⚠️ [SKIP STORAGE] Using placeholder URL (no file storage)');
const downloadUrl = `placeholder://document/${Date.now()}_${file.name}`;
```

### 2. Update Document Creation

The document will be created without a real storage URL:

```typescript
// 3. Create the actual document record in Firestore
console.log('💾 [STEP 3] Creating document record in Firestore...');
docId = await createDocument(
  userId,
  newDoc,
  downloadUrl  // This will be a placeholder URL
);
```

### 3. Benefits of This Approach

✅ **No billing upgrade needed**
✅ **Documents still get processed by AI**  
✅ **Transactions still extracted and saved**
✅ **Status tracking still works**
❌ **Can't download original files later**
❌ **No permanent file storage**

## 🎯 Which Option Should You Choose?

### Choose **Blaze Plan** if:
- You want to keep uploaded files permanently
- You plan to use this app seriously
- You're okay with minimal storage costs (~$1-5/month for testing)
- You want the full intended functionality

### Choose **Skip Storage** if:
- You just want to test document processing
- You don't need to store original files
- You want to avoid any billing setup
- This is temporary/prototype usage
