## 📊 **Updated Algorithm (Production Ready)**

### **New Factor Weights** (Aligned with Industry Best Practices)

| Factor | New Weight | Old Weight | Change | Justification |
|--------|------------|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Bill Payment History** | **30%** | 20% | +10% | More aligned with FICO's 35% payment history |
| **Income Consistency** | **25%** | 25% | No change | Unique to informal economy |
| **Expense Management** | **20%** | 20% | No change | Financial discipline indicator |
| **Financial Growth** | **15%** | 15% | No change | Income trend analysis |
| **Transaction Diversity** | **10%** | 10% | No change | Income source variety |
| ~~Financial Discipline~~ | ~~0%~~ | 10% | **-10%** | **Merged into Expense Management** |

### **Improved Grade Ranges**

- **A (800-1000)**: Excellent - Very low risk
- **B+ (700-799)**: Good - Low risk ⭐ *New grade*
- **B (600-699)**: Fair - Moderate risk  
- **C (500-599)**: Needs improvement - Higher risk
- **D (0-499)**: Poor - High risk
