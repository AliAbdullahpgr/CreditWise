# Firebase Authentication & Database Integration - Fixed Issues

## Date: October 11, 2025

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Critical Database Structure Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** 
- Firestore security rules expected user-scoped collections at `users/{userId}/transactions`, `users/{userId}/documents`, etc.
- Actual implementation was using root-level collections (`transactions`, `documents`, `creditReports`) with a `userId` field filter

**Impact:** 
- Security rules would have blocked all operations
- Data was not properly isolated per user
- Users could potentially query across all users' data (security risk)

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `src/lib/firebase/collections.ts` to return user-scoped collection paths
- Modified all server-side functions in `src/lib/firebase/firestore.ts` to use user-scoped paths
- Updated all client-side pages to query user-scoped collections

### 2. **Security Rules Blocking List Operations** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Firestore rules had `allow list: if false` for all collections
- This prevented users from querying their own collections

**Impact:**
- Users couldn't fetch their transactions, documents, or reports
- Dashboard and other pages would show empty data

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `allow list: if false` to `allow list: if isSignedIn() && isOwner(userId)` for all collections
- Added missing security rules for `creditReports` collection

### 3. **Missing User Profile Creation** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- No logic to create user profile document when users sign up or log in
- User document at `users/{userId}` was never created

**Impact:**
- No user metadata stored in database
- No way to track user information, creation date, last login, etc.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created `createOrUpdateUserProfile()` function in `src/lib/firebase/firestore.ts`
- Created API endpoint `/api/create-user-profile` to handle profile creation
- Updated login and signup pages to call this API after successful authentication
- User profile is now created/updated on every login with latest info

### 4. **Inconsistent Data Paths** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Different parts of the codebase used different collection paths
- API routes still referenced old root-level collections

**Impact:**
- Data would be written to different locations than where it was read from
- Inconsistent data access patterns

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated all collection references across the codebase
- Modified API routes to use user-scoped paths

## Files Modified

### Core Firebase Files:
1. `src/lib/firebase/collections.ts` - Updated collection path functions
2. `src/lib/firebase/firestore.ts` - Updated all CRUD operations + added user profile functions

### Authentication Pages:
3. `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Added user profile creation on login
4. `src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` - Added user profile creation on signup

### Application Pages:
5. `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated collection queries
6. `src/app/(app)/transactions/page.tsx` - Updated collection queries
7. `src/app/(app)/documents/page.tsx` - Updated collection queries
8. `src/app/(app)/reports/page.tsx` - Updated collection queries

### API Routes:
9. `src/app/api/create-user-profile/route.ts` - NEW: User profile creation endpoint
10. `src/app/api/generate-pdf/route.ts` - Updated to use user-scoped paths

### Security:
11. `firestore.rules` - Updated to allow list operations and added creditReports rules

## New Database Structure

### Before (WRONG):
```
root/
├── transactions/ (all users' transactions mixed)
├── documents/ (all users' documents mixed)
└── creditReports/ (all users' reports mixed)
```

### After (CORRECT):
```
users/
├── {userId}/
│   ├── profile data (email, displayName, createdAt, etc.)
│   ├── transactions/
│   │   └── {transactionId}/
│   ├── documents/
│   │   └── {documentId}/
│   └── creditReports/
│       └── {reportId}/
└── {anotherUserId}/
    ├── profile data
    ├── transactions/
    ├── documents/
    └── creditReports/
```

## User Profile Structure

Each user document at `users/{userId}` now contains:
```typescript
{
  email: string
  displayName: string | null
  photoURL: string | null
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
  lastLoginAt: Date
}
```

## Authentication Flow

### Login/Signup Process:
1. User clicks "Login with Google" or "Sign up with Google"
2. Firebase Authentication via Google OAuth
3. API call to `/api/create-user-profile` with user data
4. User profile created/updated in `users/{userId}`
5. User redirected to dashboard
6. Dashboard loads user-specific data from `users/{userId}/transactions`, etc.

## Security Model

### Firestore Rules Summary:
- ✅ Each user can only read/write their own data
- ✅ Collections are user-scoped under `users/{userId}/`
- ✅ List operations allowed for own data
- ✅ No cross-user data access possible
- ✅ Unauthenticated users have no access

### Rule Pattern (applied to all collections):
```javascript
match /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId} {
  allow get, list: if request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow create: if request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow update, delete: if request.auth.uid == userId && resource != null;
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test User Creation:**
   - Sign up with a new Google account
   - Verify user document is created at `users/{userId}`
   - Check that profile fields are populated

2. **Test Data Isolation:**
   - Create transactions/documents with User A
   - Log in as User B
   - Verify User B cannot see User A's data

3. **Test Collection Queries:**
   - Upload documents and verify they appear in documents page
   - Create transactions and verify they appear in transactions page
   - Generate reports and verify they appear in reports page

4. **Test Security Rules:**
   - Try to access another user's collection path directly
   - Verify permission denied error

## Known Issues to Monitor

1. **updateDocumentStatus Function:** Modified to use collectionGroup query since it didn't receive userId parameter. Consider refactoring to pass userId explicitly for better performance.

2. **PDF Generation:** Some TypeScript errors in generate-pdf route (reportData type). These are pre-existing and don't affect the auth/database structure fixes.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated Firestore rules to Firebase Console
2. Test the complete authentication flow
3. Verify all pages load data correctly
4. Monitor Firebase Console for any permission denied errors
5. Consider adding indexes for common queries (Firebase will suggest these)

## Migration Notes

If you have existing data in the old structure:
1. Existing data at root-level collections will no longer be accessible
2. You'll need to migrate data to the new user-scoped structure
3. Use a migration script if you have production data
4. For development, you can simply recreate test data with the new structure
