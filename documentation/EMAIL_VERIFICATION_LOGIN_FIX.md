# Email Verification Login Fix

## Problem
Users were able to sign in without verifying their email addresses. The login page would show an error message but still allow users to access the dashboard.

## Root Cause
In the login page (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`), when a user with an unverified email tried to log in:
1. The code checked if `emailVerified` was false
2. It showed an error toast
3. **BUT** it didn't sign out the user immediately
4. This caused the `onAuthStateChanged` listener in Firebase to detect the user as authenticated
5. The `useEffect` hook would then redirect them to `/dashboard`

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Login Page (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)

**Change 1: Sign out unverified users immediately**
```typescript
// Before
if (!userCredential.user.emailVerified) {
  setLastUnverifiedUser(userCredential.user);
  setShowResendSection(true);
  toast({...});
  // Don't sign out yet - keep user object for resending
  return;
}

// After
if (!userCredential.user.emailVerified) {
  setLastUnverifiedUser(userCredential.user);
  setShowResendSection(true);
  
  // CRITICAL: Sign out immediately to prevent auto-redirect to dashboard
  await auth.signOut();
  
  toast({...});
  return;
}
```

**Change 2: Fixed resend verification email function**
The previous implementation tried to send verification emails using a signed-out user object, which would fail. Now it:
1. Re-authenticates the user with their credentials
2. Sends the verification email
3. Signs out again for security

```typescript
const handleResendVerification = async () => {
  // Re-authenticate to get a fresh user object
  const userCredential = await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
  
  // Send verification email
  await sendEmailVerification(userCredential.user, {...});
  
  // Sign out after sending
  await auth.signOut();
}
```

### 2. Created Auth Guard Component (`src/components/auth-guard.tsx`)

A new component that protects app routes by:
- Checking if user is authenticated
- Verifying that the user's email is verified
- Redirecting to `/login` if either check fails
- Showing a loading state during checks

### 3. Updated App Layout (`src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`)

Wrapped the entire app layout with the `AuthGuard` component to ensure all protected routes require:
1. Authenticated user
2. Verified email address

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Try to login with an unverified email address
  - Should show error: "Email Not Verified"
  - Should NOT redirect to dashboard
  - Should stay on login page
  
- [ ] Click "Resend Verification Email" button
  - Should successfully send email
  - Should show success message
  
- [ ] Try to access dashboard directly (e.g., `/dashboard`) without logging in
  - Should redirect to `/login`
  
- [ ] Try to access dashboard with unverified email
  - Should redirect to `/login`
  
- [ ] Login with verified email address
  - Should successfully redirect to dashboard
  - Should stay on dashboard

## Additional Security Notes

1. **Client-side protection**: The current implementation uses client-side guards. For production, consider adding:
   - Server-side middleware to check authentication
   - API route protection with Firebase Admin SDK
   - Session cookies for better security

2. **Email verification flow**: 
   - Users sign up → Email sent → Must verify before login
   - Unverified users see resend button after attempting login
   - Verified users can access the app normally

3. **Google Sign-In**: Currently not implemented in the UI, but if added later, ensure it also checks email verification status.

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Fixed login logic
2. `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` - Added AuthGuard wrapper
3. `src/components/auth-guard.tsx` - New auth guard component (created)
