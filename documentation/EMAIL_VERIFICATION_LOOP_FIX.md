# Email Verification Loop Fix - January 2025

## Problem Description

Users experienced an infinite redirect loop after signup:
1. User signs up → redirected to dashboard
2. `AuthGuard` checks `emailVerified` → false
3. Redirects to login
4. User still authenticated → redirects back to dashboard
5. **Loop continues indefinitely**

Additionally, verification emails were not being sent consistently.

## Root Cause

The `AuthGuard` component was redirecting unverified users to `/login` but **not signing them out**. Since the user remained authenticated, they would immediately be redirected back to the dashboard, creating an infinite loop.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed AuthGuard Component
**File**: `src/components/auth-guard.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `useAuth()` hook to access Firebase auth
- When user is not verified, **sign them out** before redirecting
- Redirect to `/verify-email` instead of `/login`

```typescript
// Before:
if (!user.emailVerified) {
  router.push('/login');
  return;
}

// After:
if (!user.emailVerified && auth) {
  auth.signOut().then(() => {
    router.push('/verify-email');
  });
  return;
}
```

### 2. ✅ Created Verify Email Page
**File**: `src/app/(auth)/verify-email/page.tsx`

**Features**:
- Displays email verification instructions
- "I've Verified My Email" button - checks verification status
- "Resend Verification Email" button - with 60s cooldown
- "Back to Login" button - signs out and returns to login
- Automatic redirect to dashboard when verified
- User-friendly error messages

### 3. ✅ Updated Signup Flow
**File**: `src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Redirects to `/verify-email` instead of `/login` after signup
- User remains signed out until they verify

### 4. ✅ Updated Login Flow
**File**: `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- When unverified user tries to login, redirect to `/verify-email`
- Keep user authenticated so they can resend verification email
- Cleaner flow without showing resend section on login page

## User Flow After Fix

### Signup Flow
1. User fills signup form
2. Account created + verification email sent
3. User signed out
4. Redirected to `/verify-email` page
5. User checks email and clicks verification link
6. User clicks "I've Verified My Email" on verify page
7. Redirected to dashboard ✅

### Login Flow (Unverified User)
1. User tries to login with unverified account
2. Redirected to `/verify-email` page
3. User can resend verification email or check verification status
4. After verifying, click "I've Verified My Email"
5. Redirected to dashboard ✅

### Login Flow (Verified User)
1. User logs in
2. Direct access to dashboard ✅

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Clear browser cache/cookies
- [ ] Sign up with new email
- [ ] Verify redirected to `/verify-email` page
- [ ] Check email inbox (and spam folder)
- [ ] Click verification link in email
- [ ] Return to app and click "I've Verified My Email"
- [ ] Verify redirect to dashboard works
- [ ] Try logging in with unverified account
- [ ] Test "Resend Verification Email" button
- [ ] Test cooldown timer (60s)

## Firebase Console Checklist

Ensure email verification is enabled:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication
2. Click "Templates" tab
3. Find "Email address verification"
4. Ensure template is enabled and configured
5. Customize email template if needed

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:9003  # Or your production URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
# ... other Firebase config
```

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending
1. Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Templates
2. Verify email verification is enabled
3. Check Firebase quotas and limits
4. Look for errors in browser console

### Still Experiencing Loops
1. Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Clear cookies for your domain
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode

### Verification Not Working
1. Check that user clicked the correct verification link
2. Ensure link hasn't expired (usually 1 hour)
3. Try resending verification email
4. Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Users to see if email is verified
