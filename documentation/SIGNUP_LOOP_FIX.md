# Signup Loop & Email Verification Issue - Quick Fix Guide

## Issue Description
After signup, users experience:
1. Redirect loop between pages
2. Warning: "Account created but verification email could not be sent"

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Prevent Signup Page Auto-Redirect During Process
**File**: `src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`

Added `isRedirecting` state flag to prevent the useEffect from redirecting to dashboard during the signup/signout process.

```typescript
const [isRedirecting, setIsRedirecting] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  // Don't redirect if we're in the middle of signup process
  if (!isUserLoading && user && !isSigningUp && !isRedirecting) {
    router.push('/dashboard');
  }
}, [user, isUserLoading, isSigningUp, isRedirecting, router]);
```

### 2. Added Delay After SignOut
Added a 100ms delay after `auth.signOut()` to ensure the auth state fully updates before navigation.

```typescript
// Sign out the user
await auth.signOut();

// Small delay to ensure signOut completes
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));

// Then redirect
router.push('/verify-email');
```

## üîß Email Verification Not Sending - Firebase Console Fix

The warning "verification email could not be sent" indicates Firebase email templates need configuration.

### Steps to Fix in Firebase Console:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Select your project**: HisaabScore
3. **Navigate to Authentication**:
   - Click "Authentication" in left sidebar
   - Click "Templates" tab at the top
4. **Configure Email Verification Template**:
   - Find "Email address verification" 
   - Click the pencil icon to edit
   - **Ensure it's enabled** (toggle should be ON)
   - Review the template content
   - Save changes

### Email Template Settings:
- **From name**: HisaabScore (or your preferred name)
- **From email**: noreply@hisaabscore.firebaseapp.com (default)
- **Subject**: Verify your email for HisaabScore
- **Action URL**: Should point to your domain

### Check Email Provider Settings:
1. In Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Settings
2. Under "Authorized domains", ensure:
   - `localhost` is listed (for development)
   - Your production domain is listed
3. Check that email/password authentication is enabled:
   - Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
   - Email/Password should be "Enabled"

## üß™ Testing Steps

1. **Clear browser data**:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console (F12) and run:
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   // Then close and reopen the browser
   ```

2. **Try signup with a new email**:
   - Should redirect to verify-email page
   - Should NOT loop between pages
   - Should either:
     - ‚úÖ Show success message if email sent
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è Show warning if email failed (but page loads correctly)

3. **Check browser console** for any errors:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for Firebase errors in Console tab
   - Look for network errors in Network tab

4. **Check email inbox**:
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Email should come from: noreply@hisaabscore.firebaseapp.com
   - If no email arrives, it's a Firebase Console configuration issue

## üìß Alternative: Manual Email Verification Test

If emails still don't send, you can manually verify users for testing:

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
2. Find the user you just created
3. Look at the "Email verified" column
4. For testing, you can manually mark it as verified (not recommended for production)

## üêõ Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Templates ‚Üí Email verification is **ENABLED**
- [ ] Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method ‚Üí Email/Password is **ENABLED**
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] Authorized domains include `localhost` and your production domain
- [ ] Signup redirects to `/verify-email` (not looping)
- [ ] After signup, user is signed out (check Firebase Auth state in DevTools)
- [ ] `.env.local` has correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

## üîç Debug Mode

To see more details about the email sending error, check browser console after signup. The error will be logged:

```typescript
console.error('Email verification error:', emailError);
```

Common error codes:
- `auth/invalid-continue-uri` - The continue URL is invalid
- `auth/unauthorized-continue-uri` - The domain is not authorized
- `auth/missing-continue-uri` - No continue URL provided
- `auth/too-many-requests` - Rate limited

## ‚úÖ Expected User Flow

1. User fills signup form
2. Account created in Firebase Auth
3. Verification email sent (or warning shown)
4. User signed out automatically
5. Redirected to `/verify-email` page (clean, no loop)
6. User checks email
7. Clicks verification link
8. Returns to app and clicks "Back to Login"
9. Logs in successfully
10. Redirected to dashboard ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Quick Deploy Test

After making changes:

```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

Then test the signup flow with a fresh browser session (incognito mode).
